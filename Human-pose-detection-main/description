 Project Description
This project is a Streamlit-based web application for pose estimation and basic activity recognition from images and videos using MediaPipe and OpenCV[1]. Users can upload an image or video, and the app will detect human poses and classify them as "Standing," "Sitting," "Lying Down," or "Unknown Pose" based on adjustable thresholds.

Features:
- Pose Detection: Utilizes the MediaPipe Pose solution to detect and visualize human body landmarks in images and videos.
- Activity Recognition: Classifies detected poses into standing, sitting, or lying down using customizable thresholds for greater flexibility and accuracy.
- Interactive Threshold Adjustment: Users can fine-tune the thresholds for each activity type directly from the sidebar to better suit different body types or camera angles.
- Image and Video Support: Accepts both image (`.jpg`, `.png`) and video (`.mp4`) uploads for processing.
- Real-time Feedback: Displays processed images or video frames with pose landmarks and activity labels overlaid.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

Usage:
1. Launch the Streamlit app.
2. Upload an image or video file via the sidebar.
3. Adjust the standing, sitting, and lying down thresholds as needed.
4. View the processed image or video with pose landmarks and activity classification.

This tool is ideal for quick prototyping, educational purposes, or as a starting point for more advanced pose-based activity recognition projects.
